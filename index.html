        <p>Sojourner is the Mars Pathfinder robotic Mars rover that landed on July 4, 1997
           in the Ares Vallis region, and explored Mars for around three months. It has front and rear
            cameras and hardware to conduct several scientific experiments. Designed for a mission lasting 7 sols, with possible extension to 30 sols,
             it was in fact active for 83 sols (85 earth days). The base station had its last communication session with Earth at 3:23 a.m. 
             Pacific Daylight Time on September 27, 1997. Sojourner traveled a distance of just over 100 meters (330 ft) by the time communication was lost.
              It was instructed to stay stationary until October 5, 
          1997 (sol 91) and then drive around the lander. Sojourner is the first wheeled vehicle to rove another planet</p>

        <div class="image-opportunity">Opportunity</div>
        <p>also known as MER-B (Mars Exploration Rover – B) or MER-1, and nicknamed "Oppy",
           is a robotic rover that was active on Mars from 2004 until the middle of 2018. Launched on July 7, 2003, as part of NASA's
           Mars Exploration Rover program, it landed in Meridiani Planum on January 25, 2004, three weeks after its twin Spirit (MER-A)
            touched down on the other side of the planet. With a planned 90-sol duration of activity (slightly more than 90 Earth days), 
            Spirit functioned until it got stuck in 2009 and ceased communications in 2010, while Opportunity was able to stay operational for 
            5111 sols after landing, maintaining its power and key systems through continual recharging of its batteries using solar power, and hibernating 
            during events such as dust storms to save power. This careful operation allowed Opportunity to exceed its operating plan by 14 years, 46 days 
            (in Earth time), 55 times its designed lifespan. By June 10, 2018, when it last contacted NASA, the rover had traveled a distance of 
            45.16 kilometers (28.06 miles).
